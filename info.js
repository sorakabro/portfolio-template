The former is executed by providing a platform for communities that are geographically positioned in the same proximity (Housing societies, Dorms, Apartment Complexes) to have and share data (exact apartment addresses, phone number, apartment housing rules, individuals tested positive for COVID-19) in an exclusive platform. The latter is to give these people in the community the ability to carry out a task you are physically or remotely unable to do; with dignity and ease."
